# Quote Bot (WIP / Paused)

This project is an experimental Discord bot written in Rust using Poise + Serenity.

Development is currently paused.

Reason:
- The project grew beyond its original scope
- I want to revisit it later and rebuild it end-to-end with my own design decisions,
  rather than continue incrementally on top of heavy framework abstractions. (Aka I 
  tried vibe coding it and that was stupid)

What exists:
- Working bot connection
- Slash command infrastructure
- Clean async + Rust setup

What does not exist yet:
- Persistent config
- Quote scheduling
- Production hardening

This repo is kept as a reference point, not an actively maintained project.
